# Readme

This folder contains example commits and the file diffs that can be used for
testing the git commit suggestion tool.

  - [angular.md](./angular.md)
  - [git.md](./git.md)
  - [go.md](./go.md)
  - [react.md](./react.md)

Each file contains a `commit message` and a `diff`. The `commit message` is the
real commit message used in the project. This can be compared with the one
generated by OpenAI.
`diff` is the git diff that can be used as input to the CLI tool.

For reference, this is how I got the diff:

```sh
# checkout any interesting commit
$ git checkout f8de255e94540f9018d8196b3a34da500707c39b

# store files changed in file
$ git diff HEAD~ > diff.txt

# alternatively you can copy them to clipboard directly (use 'xclip -selection clipboard' on linux)
$ git diff HEAD~ | pbcopy
```
