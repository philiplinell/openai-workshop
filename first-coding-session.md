# First Coding Session

~ 15 minutes.

Goals to achieve:

1. Get an OPENAI KEY. If you do now wish to create an account, send me a slack
   message and I'll send you one.
   It is recommended to set a hard limit on your API usage. Do so
   [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits).

2. Decide on a strategy for how to interact with the tool you are creating

    2.1 Read filename

    2.2 Read entire diff

    2.3 Get diff using a git library

3. Get the diff into your tool

4. Send a request from your tool to the OpenAI API.
    Use a [library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries) or build your
    own.
