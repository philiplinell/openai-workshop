# Introduction

---

## Workshop Structure

- Introduction (this is where we are now!)
- Coding Session 1
- OpenAI Details
- Coding Session 2
- Wrap Up

---

## What Will We Build?

**DEMO TIME**

- The file name is passed as a parameter.
- The git diff (file-content) is then parsed.
- The git diff is then passed into a prompt sent to the OpenAI API.
- The response is returned from the CLI tool.

---

## What Is OpenAI?

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab.

The mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity.

The organization started and continues to be a **non-profit**, but has a subsidiary that is a **capped for-profit** company. The goal with this structure is to try to strike a balance between the slow pace of non-profit and the speed of a for-profit.

---

## Models

The different models have different purposes, such as generating code, images, natural language, etc.

| Model   | Purpose                                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| DALL E  | Image generation from natural language                      |
| Whisper | Speech recognition model                                    |
| Embeddings | Measures relatedness of text strings. Use cases are search, recommendations, anomaly detection etc. |

For our project, we are utilizing **GPT-3**, a language model, due to its ability
to understand and generate meaningful responses from text inputs.

---

## Note on Proprietary Data

Be mindful of the data you send to OpenAI. Even though the data sent via the API is **not used** to improve the models, you should have permission from your client if you use any tools (such as the one we are building) professionally.

---

## Cost Considerations

- Different models have different price points.
- The pricing is pay as you go, and you pay per 1,000 *tokens*.
- New accounts get $5 in free credit that can be used during your first 3 months.

- Setup billing limits: [platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits)

See more on [openai.com/pricing](https://openai.com/pricing).

---

## Libraries

Libraries exist for many programming languages. See the list [openai.com/docs/libraries](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries).

It is also possible to write your own library if you wish.

---

## Strategy for interacting with our CLI tool

We somehow need to get the git diff into our CLI tool. We can do this in
multiple ways, some of which are:


* Pass filename that contains git diff

Probably easiest ‚≠ê

E.g.
```sh
$ commit-msg --filename=.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG
```

* Read entire diff

E.g.
```sh
$ commit-msg --changes=$(git diff)
```

* Get diff using a git library

This would use a git library (or call git as a shell command) to get a git diff.

---

# Lets get coding!

Lets get the ball rolling during this first coding session. Get an API KEY,
decide on how you want to interact with your CLI, store the git diff in memory
and try to send any request to OpenAI API.

This should take about ~ 15 minutes.
